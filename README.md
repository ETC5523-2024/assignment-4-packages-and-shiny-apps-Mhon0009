## Overview

This package contains comprehensive data on Valentine's Day spending trends over the past decade which provided 
by NRF who has surveyed consumers about how they plan to celebrate Valentine’s Day annually for over a decade. 
It includes datasets that capture total expected spending, average spending per person, spending per type of gift,
and consumer-preferred types of gifts broken down by age and gender. This package is designed to help users analyze 
consumer behavior and spending patterns during Valentine’s Day especially for the retailers. 


Take a deeper dive into the data from the last 10 years, and use the interactive charts to explore a demographic breakdown of total spending, average spending, 
types of gifts planned and spending per type of gift.

This package provides the following datasets.
